# Save The Parents

### The Purpose
I wanted to start a project that would help me learn about the .NET Framework and MVC. This web application has no official purpose for my making it other than for educational purposes.

### The Concept
The goal was to design a website so that parents could go and rate children's products. There would be a text review as well as a rating for the parent and the child in the form of a number or star. I got this idea from a book that I had to read to my kids. I thought, "Why didn't anyone warn me". So this application is a playful joke about that.

### Main Functionality
- Users should be able to view all products and reviews with no account
- Users can create accounts
- Users can create products that become publicly visible
- Users cannot delete or edit products
- Users may create edit and delete their own reviews for any product

### Future Plans
- Sort products by ratings
- Add an admin portal to moderate reviews and products
- Search functionality
- Filtering by category or product type

### How to get it running
To test out my project you will have to have Visual Studio installed. If you run the application from visual studio it should create an empty database for you to play around with locally.
